1- write a query to print top 5 cities with highest spends and their percentage contribution of total credit card spends

with cte1 as(
select city, sum(amount) as total_spent 
from credit_card_transactions
group by city),
cte2 as (select sum(amount) as total_amount from Credit_card_transactions)
select TOP 5 cte1.*, (total_spent*1.0/total_amount)*100 as perc_spent
from cte1 inner join cte2 on 1=1
order by total_spent DESC
 
2- write a query to print highest spend month and amount spent in that month for each card type

with cte as (
select card_type,datepart(year,date) yt
,datepart(month,date) mt,sum(amount) as total_spend
from credit_card_transactions

)
select * from (select *, rank() over(partition by card_type order by total_spend desc) as rn
from cte) a where rn=1


3- write a query to print the transaction details(all columns from the table) for each card type when
it reaches a cumulative of 1000000 total spends(We should have 4 rows in the o/p one for each card type)

with cte as (
select *,sum(amount) over(partition by card_type order by transaction_date,transaction_id) as total_spend
from credit_card_transcations
--order by card_type,total_spend desc

select * from (select *, rank() over(partition by card_type order by total_spend) as rn  
from cte where total_spend >= 1000000) a where rn=1


4- write a query to find city which had lowest percentage spend for gold card type

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT city, 
           SUM(amount) AS total_amount, 
           SUM(CASE WHEN card_type = 'Gold' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS gold_amount
    FROM Credit_card_transactions
    GROUP BY city
)
SELECT top 1 city,

ORDER BY gold_ratio;


5- write a query to print 3 columns:  city, highest_expense_type , lowest_expense_type (example format : Delhi , bills, Fuel)

with cte1 as(
select city, exp_type, sum(amount) as total_amount ,RANK() over (partition by city order by sum(amount) DESC) as rnk_desc
from Credit_card_transactions
group by city, exp_type),
cte2 as (
select city, exp_type, sum(amount) as total_amount ,RANK() over (partition by city order by sum(amount)) as rnk_asc
from Credit_card_transactions
group by city, exp_type
)
select cte1.city, cte1.exp_type as highest_expense_type, cte2.exp_type as lowest_expense_type
from cte1 inner join cte2
on cte1.city = cte2.city
where rnk_asc = 1 AND rnk_desc = 1
order by Cte1.city

6- write a query to find percentage contribution of spends by females for each expense type

with cte1 as(
select exp_type, gender, sum(amount) as total_spent from Credit_card_transactions
where gender = 'F'
group by exp_type, gender
), cte2 as(
select exp_type, sum(amount) as total_amt from Credit_card_transactions
group by exp_type)
select cte1.Exp_Type, cte1.gender, FORMAT(round((total_spent*1.0/total_amt)*100,2), 'N2') as perc_spent 
from cte1 
inner join cte2 
on cte1.exp_type = cte2.exp_type
order by perc_spent desc


7- which card and expense type combination saw highest month over month growth in Jan-2014

with cte as (
select card_type,exp_type,datepart(year,date) yt
,datepart(month,date) mt,sum(amount) as total_spend
from Credit_card_transactions
group by card_type,exp_type,datepart(year,date),datepart(month,date)
)
select  top 1 *, (total_spend-prev_mont_spend) as mom_growth
from (
select *
,lag(total_spend,1) over(partition by card_type,exp_type order by yt,mt) as prev_mont_spend
from cte) A
where prev_mont_spend is not null and yt=2014 and mt=1
order by mom_growth desc;


8- during weekends which city has highest total spend to total no of transcations ratio 

select TOP 1 city, sum(amount)*1.0/count(city) as ratio from Credit_card_transactions
where DATENAME(weekday, date) in ('Saturday','Sunday')
group by city
order by ratio DESC

9- which city took least number of days to reach its 500th transaction after the first transaction in that city

with cte as(
select City, date, ROW_NUMBER() over (partition by city order by date) as rn from Credit_card_transactions
)

select top 1 city, datediff(day,min(date),max(date)) as dd 
from cte
where rn = 1 or rn = 500
group by city
having count(city) = 2
order by dd
